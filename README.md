# Samurai App v0.0.7

**Samurai App** is a secure and beautifully themed vault application for organizing your **images and videos** in a private, user-friendly interface. 
[**Download APK - v0.0.7**](https://github.com/Samurai-Vault/Samurai/raw/main/APK/Samurai.v0.0.7.apk)

Most vault apps are packed with intrusive ads, raising concerns about how private your data really is. **Samurai App** was created to give users **ultimate privacy**, a **completely ad-free experience**, and the confidence of transparency through its **open-source code**. 

Built using **Kodular** – visit the [AIA repository](https://github.com/Samurai-Vault/aia) to get access to the latest source `.aia` project file.
